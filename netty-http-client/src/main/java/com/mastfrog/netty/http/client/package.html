        <h2>Async HTTP Client</h2>
        An asynchronous HTTP client using Netty 4.x or greater.  The distinguishing
        feature of an asynchronous HTTP client is the ability to concurrently
        execute multiple requests using a smaller number of threads than there
        are requests.
        <p/>
        Another distinguishing feature is that the normal pattern of use is
        to provide a callback which will be called with the result of a response,
        rather than waiting for the response to be synchronously executed.
        <p/>
        The API here is inspired a bit by <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>'
        <code>http </code> module; it is designed to (mostly) avoid the 
        Future pattern, which a number of similar libraries seem to be stuck on
        (the point of async code is not <i>not</i> block; if an asynchronous
        API is all about "here's a thing you can block on while we make an
        asynchronous call" then it has failed).
        <p/>
